== tkhelp
=== by Lion Kimbro

tkhelp fixes bugs and exposes the native tkinter system.

tkhelp is:
* workarounds to bugs in tkinter/tk
** .bind's "add" parameter, and .unbind w/ a funcid
* missing functionality, such as:
** widget inspection  (IN PLANNING)
** scheduling inspection (.after, .after_idle)  (IN PLANNING)
** locating widgets

tkhelp is NOT:
* a wrapper around tkinter widgets (*)
* a framework for creating GUIs

tkhelp is very simple, but can make a huge difference in your tkinter
programming, because it lets you see what tkinter sees, and then you
don't have to keep track of so much on your own.

For example, you can print out the widget hierarchy, and then refer to
widgets by name or ID.  The alternative is to make your own parallel
data structures and keep track of references to widgets.  Wherever you
see code like "self.quit_button = tkinter.Button(...)", you are seeing
evidence of duplicate bookkeeping -- duplicate, because tkinter already
has a widget tree constructed.  The only thing missing is functions that
help you see the tree, and find things inside the tree.  That is what
tkhelp provides.  So when you need to find that button, write:
"find('quit', origin=self)", and you'll find the first widget named
"quit" beneath self in the widget hierarchy.  This may look like a small
thing, but it frees up an enormous amount of mental tracking.

(*) There ARE some places where wrapping occurs:
* binding is wrapped, because binding is broken
* scheduling is wrapped, because scheduling cannot be introspected
